# Conclusion
This data visualization project gives a scientific view about the security status and crime rates in Chicago city between the years 2014 – 2018. According to the analysis and visualization result, most frequent crime and most frequent locations can be easily viewed. Most frequent crime locations were street, residence, apartments, sidewalk, retail store, restaurant, yard, and alley. The most frequent crimes occurred at these locations were assault, battery, burglary, criminal damage, deceptive practice, motor vehicle theft, narcotics, robbery, and theft. Even though Chicago crime rate was high over the years, the arrest rate was just 21.24%, making us believe that there were flaws in the Chicago security department. Therefore, by analysing the data efficiently can provide valuable information, which can be used to increase the efficiency of the security systems.
